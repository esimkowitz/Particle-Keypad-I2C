Particle-Keypad-I2C is Evan Simkowitz's adaptation of Sandro Lange's Spark Core port of Alexander Brevig and Mark Stanley's Keyboard Arduino library. The Adafruit_MCP23008 library is Evan Simkowitz's Particle IDE port of Limor Fried/Ladyada's library for Adafruit Industries. The Adafruit_MCP23017 library is Paul Kourany's Particle IDE port of Limor Fried/Ladyada's library for Adafruit Industries.

This library allows for operation of a keypad over I2C. This library is compatible with the following Particle boards: Photon, P1, Electron, Core. Currently the supported I2C chips are the MCP23017 and MCP23008.

I plan to add support for more I2C chips in the future so stay tuned! That said, if anyone wants to help me with that, I would be much obliged! Enjoy and please send pull requests if you add any functionality.
